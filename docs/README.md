## Overview

This page hosts the R learning materials for the **EPIET Outbreak
Investigation module (OIM)**.

In particular, you will find the R materials for:

- School dinner foodborne outbreak case study (Copenhagen, Denmark)
- Social network analysis practical exercise
- GIS mapping raw milk outbreak case study (UK)
- *Campylobacter* water-borne outbreak case study (optional exercise)

Credits go to the original authors of the case studies, as well as the
contributors who subsequently adapted the R companion guides (see
version history in the guides for a full list of authors and
contributors). The guides are reviewed and updated annually.

These case studies are covered by a Gnu General Public Licence version 3
(GPL-3). Please read the [licence
conditions](https://github.com/EPIET/OutbreakInvestigation/blob/master/LICENSE)
before using or distributing this case study. Additional details on
distrubution are also included in the case study guides.

### Copenhagen School dinner case study

To follow the Copenhagen school dinner case study, you will need:

- [R Copenhagen case study
  materials](https://epiet.github.io/OutbreakInvestigation/Copenhagen_R_casestudy.zip)
  (contains data sets, case study guide and R coding template)
- [R Copenhagen case study
  guide](https://epiet.github.io/OutbreakInvestigation/Copenhagen_R_guide.html)
  (online version)

### Social network analysis practical

To follow the social network analysis practical, you will need:

- [R Social network analysis practical materials
  folder](https://epiet.github.io/OutbreakInvestigation/Network_analysis_practical.zip)

### Mapping case study

To follow the UK mapping case study, you will need:

### Campylobacter waterborne outbreak case study

Note: this is an optional exercise, which covers the same analysis
strategy as the Copenhagen school dinner case study, but uses an older
code base. We suggest you try this exercise If you have extra time and
adapt the code to consolidate your learning.
